### Exercises and Solutions for Evaluation in Module 2. MySQL & Sakila Database

This repository contains the exercises of the Evaluation of ADALAB's Module-2-Promo-B-da-pt.


Exercises and solutions are included in the .sql file, but remember, questions probably have more than one solution.

Exercises were performed in MySQL using the Sakila Database.
Be sure to check documentation about Sakila in:

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-introduction.html

Briefly, Sakila is a sample database that provides a standard schema that can be used for learning and trainning with MySQL. 
Sakila mimics a DVD rental shop (before the onset of streaming platforms), and as such, it has tables that contain information about films, actors, customers, rentals and so forth. 

Sakila schema contains the following tables:
1. actor 
2. address 
3. category 
4. city 
5. country 
6. customer 
7. film 
8. film_actor 
9. film_category 
10. film_text 
11. inventory 
12. language 
13. payment 
14. rental 
15. staff 
16. store 

Content, structure and connections amongst tables can be found in the link above, as well as instructions for installing the data base.
